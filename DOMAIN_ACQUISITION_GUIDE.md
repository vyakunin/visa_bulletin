## 💡 My Recommendation

### Best Strategy (Pragmatic Approach):

1. **First, check if `visa-bulletin.com` is available:**
   - Visit: https://www.namecheap.com
   - Search: `visa-bulletin.com`
   - If available → **Buy it immediately** ($10-15/year)
   - This is 90% as good as the non-hyphenated version

2. **If taken but inactive:**
   - Make a low offer via Sedo ($500-1,000)
   - Wait 2 weeks for response
   - If no response or too expensive → stick with `visabulletin.us` ($8/year)

3. **Don't overpay for the domain:**
   - Your total budget is $6/month for hosting
   - Spending $5,000+ on a domain doesn't make sense initially
   - Build your user base first with a cheaper domain
   - Buy premium domain later when you have revenue/users

### Alternative if visa-bulletin.com is Expensive:

**Use `visabulletin.us` ($8/year) and set up redirects later:**

1. Launch with `visabulletin.us` (available, cheap, professional)
2. Build your user base and traffic
3. Once established (6-12 months), acquire `visa-bulletin.com`
4. Set up 301 redirects from .us to .com
5. SEO juice transfers automatically

**This approach:**
- ✅ Saves money upfront
- ✅ Validates product-market fit first
- ✅ Negotiate from position of strength (proven traffic)
- ✅ Can use revenue to fund domain purchase

### For Hyphenated Domains:

**Advantages:**
- Usually available
- Cheap to register
- Still ranks well in SEO

**Disadvantages:**
- Harder to say verbally ("visa hyphen bulletin")
- Users might forget the hyphen
- Slightly less professional

**Solution:**

- Total cost: $10 + $8 = $18/year

### SEO Reality Check:

Google doesn't care about hyphens or TLDs much anymore. What matters:
1. Quality content ✅ (You have 20+ years of data)
2. User experience ✅ (Your charts and projections)
3. Page speed ✅ (Your site is fast)
4. Mobile-friendly ✅ (Bootstrap 5 responsive)

**Bottom line:** visa-bulletin.com will rank just as well as visabulletin.com
