🔍 DIAGNOSIS: EB-1 Historical Data

The data IS there going back to 2004, but EB-1 (Priority Workers) 
was 'Current' (no backlog) for most of its history!

When a category is Current, there's no meaningful priority date to show
on the chart - everyone gets processed regardless of their priority date.

**Try these categories instead to see full 20+ year history:**

1. **EB-3 (Skilled Workers)** - Has actual backlogs since 2004
   http://localhost:8000/?category=employment_sponsored&country=all&visa_class=3rd&action_type=final_action

2. **EB-3 India** - Even longer backlogs
   http://localhost:8000/?category=employment_sponsored&country=india&visa_class=3rd&action_type=final_action

3. **F4 Philippines** - Longest family backlog (20+ years visible)
   http://localhost:8000/?category=family_sponsored&country=philippines&visa_class=F4&action_type=final_action

EB-1 only started having backlogs recently (2015+), which is why you
only see meaningful data from that period!
