                <h4 class="card-title">What is this tool?</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    This is an <strong>independent, community-driven tracker</strong> for U.S. immigration priority dates published in the monthly Visa Bulletin by the Department of State.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The dashboard helps family-sponsored and employment-based visa applicants:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Track historical priority date movements over time</li>
                    <li>See when their priority date might become current</li>
                    <li>Understand retrogression patterns and trends</li>
                    <li>Compare movement across countries and categories</li>

                <h4 class="card-title">Where does the data come from?</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    All data is sourced directly from the official <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html" target="_blank">U.S. Department of State Visa Bulletin</a> archives.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    The dashboard automatically fetches new bulletins daily and parses cutoff dates going back to 2015. No manual data entry is involved—everything is extracted programmatically.

                <h4 class="card-title">How do the projections work?</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Projections are calculated using a simple rolling average:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We look at the last 12 months of cutoff date movements.</li>
                    <li>We calculate the average number of days the cutoff moves forward per month.</li>
                    <li>We project forward from the most recent bulletin to estimate when your priority date might become current.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="card-text">
                    <strong>Important caveats:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>These are rough estimates, not guarantees.</li>
                    <li>Visa Bulletin movements are influenced by many unpredictable factors: policy changes, application surges, Congressional action, USCIS processing speeds, etc.</li>
                    <li>Retrogressions (backward movements) can happen suddenly.</li>
                    <li>Use projections as a rough guide, not an official timeline.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="card-title">Who built this?</h4>
                <p class="card-text">
                    My name is <a href="mailto:vyakunin@gmail.com">Vladimir Yakunin</a>. I was sick of the siloed data scattered across different government pages and wanted to understand when my brother's immigration case would actually get processed. So I built this dashboard to visualize the trends and make sense of the Visa Bulletin's monthly updates.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    If you're in the same boat—trying to figure out when your (or a loved one's) priority date will become current—I hope this tool helps you too.
