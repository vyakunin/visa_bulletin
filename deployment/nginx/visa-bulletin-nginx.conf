# Nginx configuration for Visa Bulletin Dashboard
# 
# This configuration uses include files to avoid duplication between HTTP and HTTPS blocks.
# Location blocks are defined in visa-bulletin-locations.conf and shared by both server blocks.
# 
# SSL/HTTPS configuration is managed by Certbot during deployment.

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name visa-bulletin.us www.visa-bulletin.us;

    # Include shared location blocks
    include /opt/visa_bulletin/deployment/nginx/visa-bulletin-locations.conf;
}

# SSL Configuration (managed by Certbot)
# Certbot adds a separate server block for HTTPS (port 443) with SSL certificates.
# The HTTPS block will also include visa-bulletin-locations.conf for consistency.
