# Cursor Rules for Visa Bulletin Parser

## Bazel Build System

### Rule: One Bazel Target Per File
Always create one `py_library` or `py_binary` target per Python file unless it's impossible due to circular dependencies.

**Good:**
```python
py_library(
    name = "bulletint_parser",
    srcs = ["bulletint_parser.py"],
    deps = [":table"],
)

py_library(
    name = "table",
    srcs = ["table.py"],
)
```

**Bad:**
```python
py_library(
    name = "lib",
    srcs = [
        "bulletint_parser.py",
        "table.py",
        "other.py",
    ],
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Better granularity for incremental builds
- Clear dependency tracking
- Faster compilation (only rebuild changed modules)
- Easier to understand build graph

### Exceptions
Only bundle multiple files into one target when:
- Circular dependencies exist between modules
- Files are tightly coupled and always used together
- Performance measurements show significant benefit

## Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Testing

### Test Quality Rules

**Do NOT write trivial tests** that only check if code exists:
- ❌ BAD: Testing if an enum has a specific value (e.g., `assertEqual(MyEnum.VALUE, "value")`)
- ❌ BAD: Testing if a class exists or can be imported
- ❌ BAD: Testing simple getters/setters with no logic
- ❌ BAD: Testing that a constant equals itself

**DO write meaningful behavioral tests**:
- ✅ GOOD: Testing business logic and transformations
- ✅ GOOD: Testing edge cases and error handling
- ✅ GOOD: Testing integration between components
- ✅ GOOD: Testing data validation and constraints
- ✅ GOOD: Testing complex parsing or extraction logic

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ Trivial - just checks if value exists
def test_has_value(self):
    self.assertEqual(MyEnum.FOO.value, "foo")

# ✅ Meaningful - tests behavior
def test_parse_table_header_to_country_enum(self):
    self.assertEqual(parse_country("CHINA-mainland born"), Country.CHINA)
    self.assertEqual(parse_country("All Chargeability Areas"), Country.ALL)
```

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include meaningful behavioral tests
- Tests should use Bazel: `bazel test //tests:...`
- Run tests before committing (pre-commit hook handles this)
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Each test should verify actual behavior, not just existence

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md for developer workflow changes
- Update BAZEL.md for build system changes
- Keep inline code comments focused on "why" not "what"

## Git Workflow

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Tests run automatically via pre-commit hook
- Don't bypass hooks unless absolutely necessary
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Dependencies

- Add new dependencies to requirements.txt
- Use pinned versions for reproducibility
- Document why each dependency is needed
