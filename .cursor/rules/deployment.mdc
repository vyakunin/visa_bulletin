# Deployment and Rollout Rules

## Rule: Always Ask About Version Before Rollout

**ALWAYS ask the user if they want to update the version before deploying/rolling out.**

**Before any deployment or rollout, ask:**
```
Do you want to tag this as a new version before deploying?
  1. Yes, create new version tag (e.g., v1.2.3)
  2. No, deploy current latest
  3. Deploy specific existing version (specify which)
```

**Rationale:**
- Versions provide clear deployment history
- Enable easy rollbacks to known good versions
- Track what was deployed when
- Follow semantic versioning best practices

## Deployment Methods

This project supports three deployment methods:

### Method 1: Tag-Based Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# 2. Tag release
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release 1.2.3: Feature X"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 3. Wait for GitHub Actions to build image

# 4. Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/ssh-key.pem v1.2.3
```

### Method 2: Deploy Latest
```bash
# Deploy whatever is currently tagged as 'latest'
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/ssh-key.pem latest
```

### Method 3: GitHub Actions Deployment
```bash
# Trigger via CLI
source ~/.shrc && gh workflow run deploy-production.yml -f version=v1.2.3

# Or via GitHub web UI
```

## Rollout Flow

See `ROLLOUT_FLOW.md` for the complete step-by-step process.

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails or issues arise:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Deploy previous version
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/ssh-key.pem v1.2.2
```

### Emergency Rollback (Docker → Systemd)
```bash
ssh lightsail 'cd /opt/visa_bulletin && \
  sudo sed -i "s/127\.0\.0\.1:8001/127.0.0.1:8000/g" deployment/nginx/visa-bulletin-locations.conf && \
  sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx'
```

## Testing Before Deployment

**Always test major changes locally with `act` before pushing:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
source ~/.shrc
act -W .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml -j build-and-push
```

## Monitoring After Deployment

After any deployment:
```bash
# Check site is up
curl -I https://visa-bulletin.us

# Check Docker logs
ssh lightsail "cd /opt/visa_bulletin && sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs --tail=50"

# Monitor for 10-15 minutes for errors
```
