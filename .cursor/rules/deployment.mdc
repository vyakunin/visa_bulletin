# Deployment and Rollout Rules

## Pre-Deployment Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY version tag or deployment, verify:**

- [ ] All tests passing (`bazel test //tests:all` - pre-commit hook handles this)
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to main
- [ ] **IF workflow changed:** Test with `act --dryrun` ⚠️ 
- [ ] Version number decided (ask user)
- [ ] Release notes written for tag message

**Critical:** If `.github/workflows/*.yml` modified, **MUST** run `act` before tagging!

## Rule: Always Ask About Version Before Rollout

**ALWAYS ask the user if they want to update the version before deploying/rolling out.**

**Before any deployment or rollout, ask:**
```
Do you want to tag this as a new version before deploying?
  1. Yes, create new version tag (e.g., v1.2.3)
  2. No, deploy current latest
  3. Deploy specific existing version (specify which)
```

**Rationale:**
- Versions provide clear deployment history
- Enable easy rollbacks to known good versions
- Track what was deployed when
- Follow semantic versioning best practices

## Deployment Methods

This project supports three deployment methods:

### Method 1: Tag-Based Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# 2. TEST WORKFLOW WITH ACT (if workflow changed)
cd /path/to/project
source ~/.shrc
act -W .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml -j build-and-push --dryrun

# 3. Tag release
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release 1.2.3: Feature X"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 4. Wait for GitHub Actions to build image

# 5. Run pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh ~/.ssh/lightsail_visa_bulletin

# 6. Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/.ssh/lightsail_visa_bulletin v1.2.3
```

### Method 2: Deploy Latest
```bash
# Run pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh ~/.ssh/lightsail_visa_bulletin

# Deploy whatever is currently tagged as 'latest'
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/.ssh/lightsail_visa_bulletin latest
```

### Method 3: GitHub Actions Deployment
```bash
# Trigger via CLI
source ~/.shrc && gh workflow run deploy-production.yml -f version=v1.2.3

# Or via GitHub web UI
```

## Rollout Flow

See `ROLLOUT_FLOW.md` for the complete step-by-step process.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

**ALWAYS run pre-deployment checks before deploying to catch configuration issues:**

```bash
# Run health checks on production environment
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh ~/.ssh/lightsail_visa_bulletin
```

**The script validates:**
- Port 8000 availability (detects old systemd services)
- Docker and docker-compose installation
- Nginx proxy configuration (should point to port 8000)
- SSL certificate status
- Disk space availability
- Docker service running
- Stale containers

**If checks fail:** Follow the suggested fixes before proceeding with deployment.

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails or issues arise:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Deploy previous version
./scripts/deploy.sh ~/ssh-key.pem v1.2.2
```

### Emergency Rollback (Docker → Systemd)
```bash
ssh lightsail 'cd /opt/visa_bulletin && \
  sudo sed -i "s/127\.0\.0\.1:8001/127.0.0.1:8000/g" deployment/nginx/visa-bulletin-locations.conf && \
  sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx'
```

## Testing GitHub Actions Workflows

**🚨 MANDATORY: Test workflow changes with `act` before pushing tags 🚨**

**When to run `act`:**
- ✅ **ALWAYS** when `.github/workflows/*.yml` files are modified
- ✅ **ALWAYS** before creating a new version tag if workflow changed
- ✅ When Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml changes affect build

**How to test:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
source ~/.shrc

# Dry run (fast, checks syntax and steps)
act -W .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml -j build-and-push --dryrun

# Full run (slower, actually builds - use for major changes)
act -W .github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml -j build-and-push
```

**Why this matters:**
- Failed workflows waste GitHub Actions minutes
- Broken tags require deletion and recreation
- Prevents deployment blockers
- Catches configuration errors before production

**If you skip this step:**
- Risk: Broken builds discovered only after pushing tag
- Impact: Deployment delays, tag management overhead
- Cost: Wasted CI/CD time and manual fixes

## Monitoring After Deployment

After any deployment:
```bash
# Check site is up
curl -I https://visa-bulletin.us

# Check Docker logs
ssh lightsail "cd /opt/visa_bulletin && sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml logs --tail=50"

# Monitor for 10-15 minutes for errors
```
